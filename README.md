Seigr Blockchain
================

Seigr blockchain is a decentralized blockchain project. This blockchain will focus on beekeeping, research, art and gaming. The Seigr blockchain is a hybrid blockchain that will use both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. 

Using a GUI, users will be able to interact with the blockchain. The GUI, written in Javascript, will allow users to manage their own nodes (full or light), create wallets, send and receive transactions, and mine blocks. From the GUI, users will also be able to access dApps (decentralized applications) that will be built on the Seigr blockchain.

Nodes in the Seigr network will be able to communicate with each other using a P2P protocol. The P2P protocol will allow nodes to share information about the blockchain, such as the latest block, and also allow nodes to share transactions with each other. 

By connecting beekeepers, researchers, artists and gamers, the Seigr blockchain will be able to provide a platform for collaboration and innovation. We need to understand how climate change is affecting bees so we can help and protect them. New technologies combined with ecological beekeeping can help us find new solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. We need to protect the bees so we can protect ourselves!
